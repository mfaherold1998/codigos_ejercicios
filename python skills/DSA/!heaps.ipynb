    "\n",
    "There's no convenient way of searching for a particular key value in a heap. Entries are only partially ordered; clever use of the heap property can allow for some pruning of searches.\n",

    "- Finding the minimum distance between two nodes in a graph\n",
    "- Getting the next event that is scheduled to occur\n",
